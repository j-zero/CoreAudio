# CoreAudio

This is a Ray Molenkamp's CoreAudio library for .NET, downloaded from the [XFX blog][dl].
The purpose of this repo is to make it available via Git, mostly so I can include it as a submodule
in another repository.

Ray (or whoever is currently maintaining this library): If you'd like ownership of this repository,
send me an e-mail.

## Modifications

## License

The library is licensed under what appears to be the zlib license. The license text is included in
all source files. For your convenience, I added a [LICENSE][license] file with a copy of it.
